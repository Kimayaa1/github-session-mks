QUES-2	What are branches in GitHub? 

ANS-2	A branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding
		a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting 
		the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another	
		line of development in the project. The primary or default branch in Git is the 
		master branch (similar to a trunk of the tree).
