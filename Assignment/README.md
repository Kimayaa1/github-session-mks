# Assignment
## Here are few problems for that you have to write a program
## Rules:
- Do not copy/paste the solution directly from internet
- Explain the approch of solving the problem
- Create a directory of your name & in there provide solution in seperate files

# Illustration:
## Sample Problem:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

### Test Case 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```
### Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

## Sample Solution:
### Code:
```py
'''
Approach #1
- iterate `nums`, if element is target then return its index, else if element exceeds target then return its index
- O(n)

Approach #2
- Use Binary Sorting Algorithim
- O(log N)
'''

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        # using binary sort algo
        lo = 0    # starting point
        hi = len(nums) - 1    # ending point
                
        while (lo <= hi):
            
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2    # accessing the mid value
            
            if (nums[mid] == target):
                return mid
            elif (nums[mid] > target):
                hi = mid - 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        
        # if all elements are smaller than target value
        return hi + 1
```

### INPUT:
```
[1,3,5,6]
5
```

### OUTPUT:
```
2
```
# Problems:
## #P1: The following code is incomplete, complete it with appropriate code & logic
```cpp
include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
void multiply(int mat1[][N],
              int mat2[][N],
              int res[][N])
{
    int i, j, k;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            res[i][j] = 0;
            for (k = 0; k < N; k++)
                res[i][j] += mat1[][] * mat2[][];
        }
    }
}
int main()
{
    int i, j;
    int res[N][N]; // To store result
    int mat1[N][N] = { { },
                       {  },
                       {  },
                       {  };
 
    int mat2[N][N] = {  },
                       { },
                       {},
                       {  } };
 
    multiply(mat1, mat2, res);
 
    cout << "Result matrix is \n";
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
            cout << res[i][j] << " ";
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
``` 
## Output should be
```
Result matrix is 
10 10 10 10 
20 20 20 20 
30 30 30 30 
40 40 40 40
```

## #P2: What are branches in GitHub? (Hint: Do read Docs that was provided in session)
ans-- A branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding
		a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting 
		the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another	
		line of development in the project. The primary or default branch in Git is the 
		master branch (similar to a trunk of the tree).


## #P3: How you store negative number in programming (you can use c++ for implementation) and if you print always positive number what will you use rather than default condition :(internet ka use nhi lena apna concept lagana hai  plagiarismâ€Œ check hoga)
ans-- The simplest is to simply use the leftmost digit of the number as a special value to 
		represent the sign of the number: 0 = positive, 1 = negative. For example, a value of 
		positive 14 (decimal) would be written as 01110 in binary, but negative 14 (decimal) 
		would be written as 11110.
>**NOTE:** <br> The main motive of assignment is to get yourself comfortable with *pushing the code*, but still we want to make your brain cells grind to increase your *problem solving skills*.
