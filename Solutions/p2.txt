#Branches in Github:

Branches in git hub is very useful tool. It is used to make diffrent copies of a project which are then undependent to each other. These copies do not make any extra folder. Even required data is store in git hidden files.

This is very useful for keeping the original project work seperate from personal edits and mistakes. Braches in github can be switched any time without going to any other folder.
