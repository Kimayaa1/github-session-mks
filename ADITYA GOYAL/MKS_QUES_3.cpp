QUES-3	How you store negative number in programming (you can use c++ for implementation) 
		and if you print always positive number what will you use rather than default condition

ANS-3	The simplest is to simply use the leftmost digit of the number as a special value to 
		represent the sign of the number: 0 = positive, 1 = negative. For example, a value of 
		positive 12 (decimal) would be written as 01100 in binary, but negative 12 (decimal) 
		would be written as 11100.
